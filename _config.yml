about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a graduate student in the field of computer science. My research is directed towards program obfuscation and the study thereof. I greatly enjoy teaching, and have found working as a teaching assistant to be very fulfilling.

  I am the current president of RPISEC, which is RPI's security club.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Being uncertain about where my interests would settle &mdash; chemistry or computer science &mdash; I wound up pursuing both. This required a great deal of time and dedication, but gave me a very broad body of knowledge.

        caption: Spring 2022
        description: I consider this to be a "formative" class for CS majors &mdash; it is where they are first exposed to a vast range of vital topics. So, it is essential that students receive all the guidance they need to come out with a good understanding of the material.

        description: I have TA'd this course twice now (and am hoping to do so for a third time this summer). Going through the material several times has greatly strengthed my understanding of cryptography, and I'm looking forward to continue sharing that knowledge.

      description: |
        Some general topics that I have significant experience with are, in no particular order:
        - Reverse engineering
        - Large-scale data collection and analysis
        - Cryptography
        - Client and server-side web exploitation
  - title: Other Experience
    layout: text
